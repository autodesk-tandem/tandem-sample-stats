## üìã Next Steps for Publication

### Step 1: Repository Setup on GitHub
1. Create new repository: `https://github.com/autodesk-tandem/tandem-sample-stats`
2. Set repository as **Public**
3. Add repository description: "Sample application for viewing statistics about Autodesk Tandem facilities"
4. Add topics/tags: `autodesk`, `tandem`, `digital-twin`, `sample`, `javascript`, `rest-api`

### Step 2: Git Migration Commands

```bash
# Navigate to the current project directory
cd /Users/jamesawe/dev/tandem/tandem-stats

# Rename the local directory (optional but recommended for consistency)
cd ..
mv tandem-stats tandem-sample-stats
cd tandem-sample-stats

# Remove existing remote (if pointing to enterprise GitHub)
git remote remove origin

# Add new public GitHub remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/autodesk-tandem/tandem-sample-stats.git

# Verify remote is correct
git remote -v

# Push to public repository (assuming you have the right permissions)
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: GitHub Repository Configuration

#### README Enhancement
The repository will automatically display the excellent README.md. Consider adding:
- Repository topics/tags for discoverability
- GitHub Actions badge (if adding CI/CD)
- Link to Tandem API documentation

#### Add GitHub Files (Optional but Recommended)

# Contributing to Tandem Sample - Stats

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This is a sample application demonstrating the Autodesk Tandem API.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tandem-sample-stats.git`
3. Create a branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Follow setup instructions in [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)

## Development Guidelines

- Follow existing code style
- Test your changes thoroughly
- Update documentation if needed
- Keep commits focused and descriptive

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your changes to your fork
2. Create a Pull Request with a clear description
3. Reference any related issues

## Questions?

- Review the [AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](./AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) for architecture details
- Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for common issues
- Open an issue for questions or discussions
```

### Step 4: Verify After Publication

After pushing to GitHub, verify:
- [ ] All files are present
- [ ] README displays correctly
- [ ] Links in documentation work (especially GitHub links)
- [ ] No sensitive information is visible
- [ ] Repository is public and accessible
- [ ] Topics/tags are set for discoverability

### Step 5: Announce & Document

1. **Internal Communication:**
   - Notify Tandem team of new sample availability
   - Share GitHub URL with documentation team
   - Update any internal wikis or developer portals

2. **External Communication:**
   - Add to Autodesk Platform Services samples catalog
   - Consider blog post or announcement
   - Link from Tandem API documentation

3. **Cross-Reference with Other Samples:**
   - Link from `tandem-sample-rest-testbed` to this sample
   - Update any comparison tables or sample directories

## üöÄ GitHub Pages Deployment

This app can be deployed to GitHub Pages with **zero configuration**:

### Quick Deploy Steps

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done)
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Source: `main` branch, root folder
   - Save

3. **Access Your App**
   - Immediate access at: `https://autodesk-tandem.github.io/tandem-sample-stats/`
   - Works instantly - no build process needed!

### Using Your Own Client ID for Deployment

If you want to use a different Client ID:

1. Create APS app with callback: `https://your-org.github.io/tandem-sample-stats/`
2. Update `js/config.js`:
   ```javascript
   apsKey: "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
   loginRedirect: "https://your-org.github.io/tandem-sample-stats/"
   ```
3. Commit and push

**Why it's so easy:** This is a pure static site with no build step. Everything loads from CDN.

## üîç Final Security Check

Before pushing to public GitHub, verify:
- [x] No API secrets in code (‚úÖ PKCE means Client ID is public and safe)
- [x] No internal URLs or endpoints
- [x] No employee information or internal references
- [x] .gitignore includes .env files
- [x] LICENSE is appropriate (MIT ‚úÖ)
- [x] No proprietary or confidential information in comments

### About the Client ID

‚úÖ **The APS Client ID IS SAFE to commit** because:
- This app uses PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) OAuth flow
- PKCE is designed for Single Page Applications where the client can't keep secrets
- The Client ID is a public identifier (like an app bundle ID)
- Security comes from the dynamic code verifier, not from hiding the Client ID
- This is standard practice for browser-based OAuth apps (see GitHub's OAuth apps, etc.)

## üìö Additional Resources

After publication, users will be able to:
1. Clone and run the sample immediately
2. Use it as a template for AI-assisted development
3. Copy the `tandem/` utilities to their own projects
4. Reference the AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md for best practices

## Notes

- The project is intentionally kept simple (no build process) for accessibility
- Uses vanilla JavaScript and CDN-based Tailwind CSS
- Designed to be AI-friendly with comprehensive documentation
- Can be extended with additional features as needed

**Current Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for publication
**Estimated Time to Complete Migration:** 15-30 minutes
**Risk Level:** Low (all sensitive data removed, thorough testing recommended)
